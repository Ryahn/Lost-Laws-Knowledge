# Species Sheet: High Human

*(Canonical Reference – Locked)*

---

## Species Name

**High Human**

Historical slurs and doctrinal labels (all incorrect, propaganda-era):

- Puppeteers

- Blood Thieves

- Stabilizer Tyrants

- False Gods

These terms appear only in hostile records or religious doctrine.

---

## Classification

**High Species**  
*(Human-derived, non-dominant, non-expansionist)*

High Humans are not an evolved form of baseline humans. They are a parallel lineage shaped by pre-modern laws of balance and alignment rather than domination or inheritance.

They are defined by **function**, not appearance.

---

## Physiology

### External

- Indistinguishable from baseline humans

- No inherent visual markers

- No “aura” visible without Qi perception

### Internal

- Permanent Qi compatibility, even when dormant

- Nervous system exhibits exceptional coherence under stress

- Resistant to feral feedback, bloodline instability, and forced bonding corruption

- Dormancy suppresses expression, not capacity

High Humans appear ordinary because **they never needed to signal power**.

---

## Lifespan

- No confirmed maximum lifespan

- Verified accounts suggest individuals reaching **300–400 years**

- Records are incomplete due to erasure, exile, and dormancy

- Aging slows significantly after full awakening

- Dormant High Humans age at near-human rates

They live long enough to become myth, not long enough to become gods.

---

## Qi and Magic Interaction

### Qi

- Always present, even in dormancy

- Flows evenly rather than explosively

- Cannot be forcibly drained, corrupted, or weaponized

- Naturally stabilizes nearby Qi fields

### Magic

- Capable, but rarely specialized

- Used primarily for alignment, correction, and stabilization

- Offensive magic exists but is culturally regarded as a failure state

High Humans could dominate magically.

They choose not to.

---

## Sovereign Instinct

**Status:** Congenital | Passive | Lost Law

Sovereign Instinct is not authority.

It is **alignment pressure**.

### Properties

- Stabilizes Qi, bonds, and bloodlines in proximity

- Reduces feral instability without suppression

- Removes the need for forced systems

- Cannot compel obedience

- Cannot override will

- Cannot be consciously weaponized

- Strength scales with consent and proximity

### Interaction with Domination

- Sovereign Instinct **fails entirely** on beings who desire domination

- It does not clash, corrupt, or destabilize

- It simply does not engage

This is why tyrants feared High Humans systemically, not individually.

---

## Psychology

### Baseline Traits

- High tolerance for ambiguity

- Low dominance drive

- Strong internal restraint

- Preference for self-correcting systems over hierarchy

### Earth Incompatibility (Dormant State)

Observed in Qi-dead environments:

- Persistent restlessness

- Chronic sense of misalignment

- Difficulty committing to artificial systems

- Feeling of something vital missing

This is environmental mismatch, not weakness or illness.

---

## Culture (Pre-Purge)

High Humans possessed everything baseline humans did:

- Art

- Music

- Architecture

- Trade

- Craft

Differences were in **refinement**, not absence.

- Art layered meaning rather than spectacle

- Music emphasized resonance and coherence

- Architecture favored longevity, repair, and quiet symbolism

Their restraint was mistaken for superiority.

---

## Political Structure: Sunfonesia

### Founder

**King Sunfone**  
High Human  
Unifier, not tyrant

- United scattered High Humans by consent

- Held authority only as long as needed

- Relinquished centralized power once stability was achieved

### Sunfonesia’s Role

- Neutral island-nation

- Trade-focused

- Stabilizing presence, not empire

### Residency Rules

Sunfonesia did not harbor other species unless:

- They were bonded to a High Human

- They were children of such bonds

- They had undergone Ancestral Sacrament (rare)

This was boundary, not exclusion.

---

## Bonds

### True Bond Convergence

Possible only with compatible **High Species**.

Characteristics:

- Fully consent-based

- Soul-level resonance

- Shared Qi and magic circulation

- Permanent but non-coercive

Effects on bonded partner:

- Unlocks sealed traits

- Stabilizes feral states

- Clarifies instincts rather than suppressing them

High Humans do not control bonds.

They remove the need for control.

---

## Reproduction and Offspring

### Offspring Expression

- Full expression of both bloodlines

- No dilution

- No locked traits

- Awakening requires training, not permission

### Sovereign Instinct in Offspring

- Latent by default

- Awakens naturally in adulthood through alignment and training

- Can partially awaken during existential crisis

- Crisis awakenings are unstable until matured

No child saviors. No prophecy shortcuts.

---

## Failure States

High Humans can fail.

Failure is not dramatic.

It is erosion.

- Ethical paralysis

- Refusal to escalate when necessary

- Prolonged misalignment

- Loss of purpose

Failed High Humans:

- Do not become villains

- Do not “fall”

- Wither, weaken, and die slowly

Power without resolve still costs lives.

---

## Sunfonesia Recognition

Sunfonesia recognizes **all High Humans equally**:

- Dormant

- Awakened

- Failed

- Broken

- Untrained

Recognition is memory, not judgment.

---

## Ancestral Sacrament

**Classification:** Lost High Human Rite  
**Eligibility:** Extremely rare

### Core Requirement

A High Human must:

- Be successfully bonded to **two mates of different species**

- Maintain long-term alignment with both bonds

### Function

Ancestral Sacrament elevates a non-High species individual to **High species status**.

This is reclassification of being, not enhancement.

---

### The Sacrifice: Severance of Origin

The transformed individual retains:

- Skills

- Memories

- Personality

They lose **instinctual belonging**.

#### What Is Lost

**Species-Instinct Communication**

- Automatic species-specific vocal meaning is severed

- Hearing such calls no longer triggers recognition

**Kin Recognition**

- Birth species no longer sense them as kin

- Comfort of shared presence vanishes

**Ancestral Memory Echoes**

- Instinctive genetic knowledge fades

- Learned knowledge remains

**Cultural Resonance**

- Rituals remain understandable but lose depth

- Songs no longer feel like home

This is not crippling.

It is isolating.

---

### What Is Gained

- Full High species status

- Freedom from bloodline degradation

- Expanded Qi and magic potential

- Eligibility for High-style bonds

- Potential cultivation of Sovereign Instinct

- Extended lifespan

They become stronger.

They become lonelier.

---

### Ritual Constraints

- Absolute consent required

- Presence of both bonded mates mandatory

- Hours-long rite

- Severe depletion of the High Human

- Cannot be performed casually or repeatedly

- Days of disorientation for the transformed individual

Ancestral Sacrament is never a reward.

It is a choice that permanently changes where you belong.

---

## Modern Status

- High Humans are considered extinct

- Actively erased from law, doctrine, and history

- Mention triggers suppression or execution

- Survivors exist only through concealment or exile

The danger of a living High Human is not power.

It is exposure.

They prove the world chose cruelty, not necessity.
