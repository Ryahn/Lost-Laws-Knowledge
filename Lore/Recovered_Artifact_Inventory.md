## **Recovered Artifact Inventory**

*Kyle & Lynia — Post-Sunfonesia Departure*

---

### 1. **Resonance Ring (Pair)**

- **Carrier:** Kyle & Lynia

- **Function:** Stabilizes true bond circulation during stress, travel, and external Qi interference.

- **State:** Fully functional

- **Why they took it:** Early convergence is not the time for “let’s wing it.”

- **Limitation:** Does nothing without consent and proximity.

---

### 2. **Stillwater Circlet**

- **Carrier:** Lynia

- **Function:** Allows voluntary feral-state engagement with full recall and exit control.

- **State:** Intact

- **Why they took it:** Lynia’s fear is data, but trauma spikes happen. This keeps choice intact.

- **Limitation:** Cannot force calm. Only clarity.

---

### 3. **Mnemonic Glass Shard**

- **Carrier:** Kyle

- **Function:** Partial memory integration of High Human law fragments.

- **State:** Fragment, stabilized

- **Why they took it:** Kyle doesn’t need everything. He needs the *right things* at the right time.

- **Limitation:** Overuse causes cognitive saturation. He stops before that.

---

### 4. **Traveler’s Null Brace**

- **Carrier:** Kyle

- **Function:** Allows sustained presence in Qi-dead or Qi-hostile environments.

- **State:** Rare, intact

- **Why they took it:** Earth already proved what incompatibility feels like.

- **Limitation:** Suppresses expression, not identity. Prolonged use dulls instinct.

---

### 5. **Qi-Weave Band (Single)**

- **Carrier:** Lynia

- **Function:** Emergency redistribution of Qi during overload or emotional cascade.

- **State:** Stable but finite

- **Why they took it:** One safety net is better than none.

- **Limitation:** Degrades with each activation. No refills.

---

### 6. **Witness Crystal (Unkeyed)**

- **Carrier:** Shared

- **Function:** Records events exactly as they occur.

- **State:** Dormant until activated

- **Why they took it:** Evidence beats testimony when institutions lie.

- **Limitation:** Cannot be edited, filtered, or framed. Even by them.

---

### 7. **Lawbound Compass**

- **Carrier:** Kyle

- **Function:** Points toward unresolved instability rather than location.

- **State:** Functional, selective

- **Why they took it:** It tells them *where they’re needed*, not where it’s safe.

- **Limitation:** Refuses to function for dominance-driven decisions.

---

### 8. **Quiet Archive Seal**

- **Carrier:** Lynia

- **Function:** Prevents alteration or corruption of stored knowledge.

- **State:** Intact

- **Why they took it:** Some truths must survive even if they don’t.

- **Limitation:** Can only protect, not reveal.

---

### 9. **Resonant Hearthstone (Miniature)**

- **Carrier:** Shared

- **Function:** Creates a small alignment-stable resting space.

- **State:** Portable, reduced range

- **Why they took it:** Sleep matters. Safety matters. Recovery matters.

- **Limitation:** Radius limited. Cannot conceal presence.

---

### 10. **Feral Voice Dampener (Damaged)**

- **Carrier:** Lynia

- **Function:** Prevents involuntary feral vocalization during acute trauma.

- **State:** Partially functional

- **Why they took it:** Even broken, it’s better than silence enforced by fear.

- **Limitation:** One-time use before failure.

---

### What They **Did Not** Take (Important)

- No city-scale stabilizers

- No waygates

- No bloodline engines

- No population-wide tools

Because carrying power meant for societies while traveling as individuals is how you accidentally become a god. And gods are the reason this world is broken.

---

### Functional Theme

Everything they carry:

- Preserves **choice**

- Prevents **collapse**

- Records **truth**

- Avoids **domination**

Nothing they carry can rule, command, or “fix the world.”

That part requires people remembering how to choose again.
