### Pattern (They Never Noticed)

- Every artifact fails when used to **control**

- Every artifact endures when used to **protect**

- None of them punish misuse with aggression

- They simply **stop cooperating**

High Humans didn’t design weapons that backfire.

They designed systems that refuse to become weapons at all.

That’s why the Great Powers had to erase the people instead of outbuilding them.
