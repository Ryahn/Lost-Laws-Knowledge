## **High Human Artifact Registry**

*Recovered, Recorded, or Theorized from Sunfonesia*

---

### 1. **Fulcrum Stone**

- **Function:** Anchors local reality alignment. Prevents feral cascade, Qi overload, and forced-bond backlash within a wide radius.

- **Status:** **Intact** (embedded beneath Sunfonesia’s central plaza)

- **Notes:** Never moved. Never meant to be.

---

### 2. **Mnemonic Glass Tablets**

- **Function:** Direct memory integration for High Humans. Transfers *remembered law*, not instruction.

- **Status:** **Partially intact**

---

### 3. **Resonance Rings**

---

### 8. **Ancestral Sacrament Anchor**

---

### 9. **Qi-Weave Bands**

---

### 11. **Bloodline Harmonizers**

- **Function:** Prevents degradation in high-compatible species lineages.

- **Status:** **Destroyed**

---

### 12. **Quiet Archive Seals**

---

### 18. **Witness Crystals**
