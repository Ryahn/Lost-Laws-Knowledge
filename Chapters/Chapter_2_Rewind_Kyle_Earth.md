# Chapter 2 — Rewind: Kyle (Earth)

Kyle grew up learning how to explain himself without understanding what he was explaining. Teachers called him distracted. Friends called him distant. Doctors called it restlessness, then depression, then nothing at all. No one ever called it *wrong*, but that was the word that fit best. Earth felt like a room he had entered mid-conversation, where everyone else knew the rules and he was expected to nod along until it ended.

He remembered the first time he asked about Mara’s “costumes.” He must have been six or seven, sitting on the living room floor while she packed away clothes that didn’t look like anything his classmates wore. Faux fur gloves, headbands shaped like ears, long coats with strange patterns sewn into them. “Is it for a convention?” he’d asked, because that was the only frame of reference he had. Mara had smiled, too carefully, and said, “Something like that.” His dad had watched from the doorway, quiet, unreadable. The question was never asked again.

Mara was always around, but never *in the way*. She lived with them without explanation, cooked meals that tasted richer than they should have, and kept the house unnaturally calm. Kyle never saw her angry. Not once. He saw irritation, amusement, concern—but never rage. As a kid, he thought that meant she was patient. As a teenager, he started to wonder if it meant she was *holding something back*.

Earth was loud in ways that didn’t make sense. Not noise, exactly, but clutter. Too many rules that contradicted each other. Too many people pretending systems worked because they’d stopped imagining alternatives. Kyle tried to care about school, about grades, about futures that involved cubicles or degrees he didn’t want, but it all felt hollow. Like building furniture in a house he didn’t intend to live in.

He felt strongest when he wasn’t trying. Running came easily. Balance came easily. He could catch things without looking, sense people behind him, wake seconds before alarms went off. Small things. Nothing supernatural. Just enough to be unsettling. When he mentioned it once, Mara had looked at him for a long moment and said, “Some people are better at listening.” He didn’t know what she meant, but he felt seen in a way that made his chest tighten.

There were nights he lay awake, staring at the ceiling, convinced something had been taken from him. Not lost. Taken. He couldn’t name it, only feel the absence like a missing tooth his tongue kept finding. He tried filling it with relationships, with work, with hobbies that burned hot and died fast. Nothing stayed. Everything felt like rehearsal for something that never arrived.

His dad never lied to him. Kyle knew that with the same quiet certainty he knew other things. But omission was a language all its own, and his father spoke it fluently. Questions about their past were answered simply, gently, and incompletely. “We moved around a lot.” “We wanted a quiet life.” “Some things are safer not explained.” Kyle accepted those answers because pushing felt like pulling on a thread he wasn’t ready to unravel.

Mara, on the other hand, watched him like she was waiting for a weather change. Sometimes he’d catch her studying him when she thought he wasn’t looking, her expression soft and unbearably sad. Once, during a thunderstorm, he’d found her standing on the back porch, rain soaking through her clothes as she stared into the dark. “Doesn’t it bother you?” he’d asked. She’d shaken her head. “Storms pass,” she said. “What matters is what they leave behind.”

Kyle tried therapy in college. The therapist asked about purpose, fulfillment, belonging. Kyle answered honestly and left every session feeling worse. How do you explain that the world feels misaligned when everyone else seems fine standing crooked? How do you say that happiness feels like a translation error? Eventually, he stopped going. It wasn’t helping, and something inside him resented being told to adapt.

The closest he came to peace was in moments of stillness. Hiking alone. Standing in the ocean at night, waves breaking against his legs, the horizon swallowing the stars. In those moments, the noise quieted. He felt grounded, almost *anchored*. But the feeling never lasted. Earth always pulled away again, like it was politely tolerating him rather than accepting him.

He never believed in destiny. Never trusted the idea of a grand plan. If there was one, it had done a terrible job explaining itself. Still, he couldn’t shake the sense that he was late to something important. That whatever he was meant to do, he was doing it badly simply by being here. That guilt followed him everywhere, quiet and persistent.

The night everything changed started like any other. Dinner with his dad. Mara laughing softly at something he said, her eyes brighter than usual. Kyle felt restless, skin buzzing, the absence in his chest sharper than it had ever been. He excused himself early, blaming exhaustion, and lay awake listening to the house breathe around him.

He never heard the world tear.

One moment he was staring at the ceiling, wondering what it would feel like to finally belong somewhere. The next, the air was gone, the ground was wrong, and his body reacted before his mind could catch up. Earth vanished without farewell.

Kyle didn’t know it yet, but the thing he had been missing his entire life hadn’t been taken from him.

It had been waiting.

And now, finally, it had found him.

## AUTHOR NOTES — Chapter 2

- Kyle’s “emptiness” should never be framed as weakness or indecision.
- Mara’s restraint is intentional foreshadowing; avoid over-explaining her behavior.
- Earth is portrayed as *incompatible*, not evil.
- This chapter should feel slower than Chapter 1, but heavier.
- Chapter 3 can:
  - Return to Sunfonesia immediately after the bond, or
  - Cut to Corand’s oracle collapse for contrast.
