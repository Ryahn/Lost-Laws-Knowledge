# Chapter 3 — Brewing Storm (Holy Kingdom Conrad)

The Holy Kingdom of Conrad was built on certainty. Long before its banners flew across conquered lands, before crusades and pyres and hymns sung over screaming cities, it had been founded on a single, immovable belief: the future was known, and Conrad alone had been chosen to interpret it. Fate was not debated here. It was dictated, enforced, and worshipped with equal fervor.

Conrad was one of the Three Great Powers, though its scholars preferred the term *shepherd*. Where other nations ruled through strength or law, Conrad ruled through inevitability. The faithful believed history bent toward them because the gods had willed it so. Those who resisted were not enemies. They were obstacles to be corrected.

At the heart of this certainty stood the Oracles.

They were not saints, despite the murals. They were not prophets, despite the chants. They were tools, bloodlines engineered over centuries, refined through forced unions and ritual scarring until they could glimpse fragments of what *might* come. The High Priestess presided over them all, her word carrying the weight of divine confirmation. When she spoke, the Pope listened. When she confirmed a fate, kingdoms burned.

The first failure was small.

An Oracle collapsed mid-vision, blood seeping from her nose, eyes wide and unfocused. The attending acolytes whispered prayers, assuming strain or impurity. The High Priestess ordered the ritual repeated with another Oracle. The second vision arrived warped, symbols blurring into nonsense before shattering entirely.

“It is nothing,” the High Priestess said coolly. “Fatigue. Prepare the next.”

Cardinal Severin watched in silence, fingers tightening around the edge of the observation rail. He had served Conrad for forty years. He had seen false alarms, heretical sabotage, even the occasional rebellious bloodline snap under pressure. This felt different. The chamber felt wrong. Quiet in a way prayer could not fill.

The third Oracle screamed.

Not in pain, but in terror. She clawed at her own eyes as if trying to tear something out of her skull, convulsing violently before collapsing. The guards rushed forward. One was too slow. The Oracle’s hand lashed out, fingers raking across his throat. Blood sprayed across the marble floor before another guard struck her down with the butt of his spear.

“Enough,” the High Priestess snapped. “Remove the body.”

The Cardinal didn’t flinch at the blood. He flinched at the silence that followed.

“This has happened before,” Severin said carefully.

The High Priestess turned slowly. “Choose your next words with care.”

Severin bowed his head, but his voice did not waver. “In the sealed manuscripts. Pre-Unification. Before the Crusades were codified.” He swallowed. “There are accounts of vision collapse. Total failure. Fragmented prophecy.”

“And what explanation did the heretics give?” she asked.

Severin hesitated. “They called it the return of an unanchored variable.”

The chamber went still.

The High Priestess’s eyes narrowed. “That term is forbidden.”

“Yes,” Severin said. “So is its implication.”

She dismissed the acolytes with a sharp gesture. As the doors closed, the quiet became unbearable. “Speak,” she commanded.

“The manuscripts describe a presence that nullifies enforced fate,” Severin said. “A stabilizer. A being whose existence disrupts prophecy itself.” He looked up, meeting her gaze. “They were erased. Officially.”

Her fingers tightened around her staff. “You are speaking of myths.”

“I am speaking of patterns,” Severin replied. “The oracles aren’t lying. They aren’t resisting. They are *blind*.”

The High Priestess turned away, pacing. “Then perform another divination. A deeper one.”

Severin’s stomach sank. “High Priestess—”

“Do it,” she said. “Now.”

The ritual circle flared brighter than any before. The final Oracle, the youngest, knelt shaking as chants filled the chamber. Symbols ignited. The air thickened. Then everything went dark.

When the light returned, the Oracle was sobbing, eyes fixed on nothing.

“There is no god,” she whispered.

The High Priestess struck her down where she knelt.

The body fell limp, blood pooling at the edge of the sigils. No one moved to help. No one dared speak.

Severin felt his faith fracture.

“This cannot be recorded,” the High Priestess said finally, her voice steady through sheer will. “This was corruption. Blasphemy. The oracles are compromised.”

“High Priestess,” Severin said quietly, “if the future cannot be seen—”

“—then it must be *made*,” she snapped. “If prophecy fails, doctrine stands. If fate is silent, we will speak for it.”

Severin bowed, though his hands trembled. “And if the manuscripts were right?”

Her gaze hardened. “Then something walks the world that must be destroyed before others remember.”

The bells of the inner cathedral began to toll, slow and deliberate.

Outside those walls, crusade banners were already being unfurled.

The storm was not yet visible to the world.

But within Conrad’s highest halls, everyone could feel it building.

## AUTHOR NOTES — Chapter 3

- Conrad’s fear should remain mostly internal at this stage.
- The High Priestess knows more than she admits; ambiguity is intentional.
- Violence is purposeful, not gratuitous—keep it restrained.
- The phrase “There is no god” should never be repeated lightly.
- Chapter 4 could:
  - Cut back to Sunfonesia as Kyle and Lynia prepare to leave, or
  - Follow Conrad’s first misdirected crusade.
