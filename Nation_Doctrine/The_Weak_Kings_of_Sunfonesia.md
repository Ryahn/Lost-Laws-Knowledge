### **The Weak Kings of Sunfonesia**

*Official Beastriax Doctrine Excerpt*

High Humans call themselves stabilizers.

That alone proves their weakness.

True strength does not *stabilize*.  
True strength **dominates**.

The High Humans of Sunfonesia hid behind balance because they could not bear hierarchy. They spoke of restraint because they feared challenge. They refused conquest not out of virtue, but because conquest would have exposed them.

They looked like humans because they lacked the courage to look like predators.

Where Beastriax forged worth through claw, scale, fang, and fire, High Humans whispered laws and called it power. They meddled in bloodlines, dulled feral edge, softened instinct, and pretended this was harmony.

It was not harmony.

It was **castration of the strong**.

They claimed they could not rule.  
The truth is simpler: they would not survive ruling.

When offered titles, they refused. When offered authority, they declined. When asked to choose a side, they hid behind neutrality. This was not wisdom. This was cowardice dressed as philosophy.

A people who will not rule deserve to be ruled.

Their so-called Sovereign Instinct was not sovereignty at all. It was rot. A passive pressure that made weaker species feel safe instead of strong, calm instead of hungry. They dulled the world so they would not be eaten by it.

Beastriax understands what Sunfonesia never did:

Strength must be tested.  
Instinct must be sharpened.  
Power must be visible.

The High Humans vanished because the world rejected stagnation.

Their ruins do not prove greatness.  
They prove **fragility preserved in stone**.

If any still live, hiding among lesser races, they are relics. And relics exist for one purpose.

To be broken.

So the world may remember what strength actually looks like.

### Why this works in-universe

- Beastriax **cannot conceptualize restraint as strength**, so they reframe it as fear.

- They equate visibility with legitimacy. If power isn’t loud, it isn’t real.

- Neutrality is treated as moral failure.

- Stabilization is recast as sabotage of natural hierarchy.

- The genocide becomes “inevitable correction,” not a crime.

This propaganda directly contradicts reality established in your canon

Sunfonesia & the Lost Truth

, which is the point. Beastriax didn’t misunderstand High Humans accidentally. They **needed** them to be weak so the purge felt justified.
