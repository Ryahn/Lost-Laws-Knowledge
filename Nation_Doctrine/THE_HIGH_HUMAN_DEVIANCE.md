# THE HIGH HUMAN DEVIANCE

### *(Corand Canonical Doctrine — Approved for Clergy, Inquisitors, and Crusade Command)*

---

## OFFICIAL DESIGNATION

**Species Name:** *Homo Dominatus*  
**Common Name:** High Humans  
**Classification:** Existential Aberration  
**Status:** Extinct (Official), Heretical Remnants (Unofficial)

> *“They called themselves stabilizers. That was the first lie.”*

---

## DOCTRINAL OVERVIEW

High Humans were not a natural species.  
They were a **manufactured deviation** that emerged during the Age of Collapse, when bloodlines failed and feral species lost discipline.

According to Corand doctrine:

- High Humans **did not evolve**

- They **did not coexist peacefully**

- They **did not act neutrally**

They **inserted themselves** into broken systems and **rewrote outcomes** to favor their own hidden dominance.

Their destruction was not genocide.

It was **containment**.

---

## CORE HERESY CLAIMS

### 1. FALSE STABILIZATION

High Humans claimed to “stabilize” feral species.

Corand doctrine states this was:

- **Psychological override**

- **Qi suppression masquerading as calm**

- **Dependency induction**

Species bonded to High Humans showed:

- Reduced autonomy

- Loss of cultural identity

- Inability to act independently once separated

This is cited as proof that High Humans **weakened civilizations**, not strengthened them.

---

### 2. SOVEREIGN INSTINCT (DECLARED A LIE)

High Humans taught of a natural law called *Sovereign Instinct*.

Corand doctrine defines this as:

> *A self-justifying myth used to excuse manipulation without accountability.*

According to approved manuscripts:

- “Alignment” was **control without visible chains**

- “Consent” was **manufactured compliance**

- “Choice” was **a constrained illusion**

Any being that claims to alter others “by existing” is, by definition, a tyrant.

---

## FALSE BOND DOCTRINE

### TRUE BOND CONVERGENCE (HERETICAL TERM)

High Humans taught that bonds formed freely and equally.

Corand scripture refutes this:

- Bonds near High Humans showed **irreversible dependency**

- Separation caused instability, grief, and bloodline collapse

- Offspring exhibited **dangerous hybrid dominance traits**

Corand doctrine therefore classifies High Human bonding as:

**Parasitic Resonance**

---

## OFFSPRING THREAT CLASSIFICATION

Children born from High Human pairings were labeled:

### *Dominion Scions*

Documented traits include:

- Unregulated Qi expression

- Simultaneous feral and rational states

- Resistance to oracle foresight

- Instinctive rejection of hierarchy

These offspring were deemed:

> **Incompatible with divine order**

Their eradication was mandated under **Sanctified Prevention Law**.

---

## SUNFONESIA: THE CORAND VERSION

Sunfonesia is recorded as:

- A rogue state

- A bloodline experimentation enclave

- A non-aligned threat to all divine systems

Corand doctrine claims:

- The island housed forced breeding programs

- Memory-altering artifacts

- Anti-prophecy constructs designed to blind gods

Its destruction is framed as a **joint moral necessity**, not a war.

The current prohibition against the island exists not from fear, but from **containment ethics**.

---

## THE “ESCAPE TO EARTH” (DENIED)

Any claim that High Humans fled to another world is officially rejected.

Corand position:

- No verified teleportation law exists

- Earth is classified as myth or minor realm

- Survivors are considered fabricated martyr narratives

Those who claim otherwise are charged with **doctrinal contamination**.

---

## ORACLE FAILURE REVISIONISM

When Corand oracles collapsed, doctrine was amended.

Official explanation:

- Oracle bloodlines were temporarily corrupted by residual High Human artifacts

- Visions declaring “no god” are labeled **vision-rot hallucinations**

- All such records are sealed or destroyed

The idea that High Humans nullify prophecy is classified as:

**The Ultimate Blasphemy**

---

## TIMELINE (CORAND-APPROVED)

### 920 Years Ago

Emergence of High Human aberrations during bloodline collapse.

### 910–900 Years Ago

High Humans infiltrate multiple civilizations under guise of stabilizers.

### 900 Years Ago

Sunfonesia identified as central contamination source.

### 899 Years Ago

Joint purgation conducted by the Three Great Powers.

### 898 Years Ago

High Human species declared extinct.

### Present Day

Residual myths persist. Crusades authorized to eliminate remaining influence.

---

## MODERN ENFORCEMENT DIRECTIVES

Any individual exhibiting the following is subject to immediate detainment or execution:

- Immunity to forced bonding

- Resistance to oracle sight

- Emotional stabilization without doctrine

- Instinctive rejection of divine hierarchy

Especially dangerous:

- Individuals who **feel “anchored” without faith**

- Those whose presence disrupts fate without effort

---

## FINAL DOCTRINAL STATEMENT

> *High Humans were not guardians.*  
> *They were not neutral.*  
> *They were not victims.*
> 
> *They were the quiet end of choice.*
> 
> *And the world is safer without them.*

### Meta Note for You, the Author

This false sheet should **almost** make sense.  
It should feel internally consistent.  
It should explain why normal people believe it.

The horror is not that it’s obviously wrong.

The horror is that it works.
