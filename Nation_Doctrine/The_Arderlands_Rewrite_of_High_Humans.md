### The Arderlands Rewrite of High Humans

Arderlands didn’t erase High Humans. That would have been suspicious. They did something more effective.

They **reframed** them.

After the purge of Sunfonesia, Arderlands positioned itself as the *sole legitimate inheritor* of “human stability.” They claimed that High Humans were never a distinct people, only an **extremist philosophical sect** of early humanity that believed in “natural balance” over governance. According to Arderlands doctrine, this sect refused hierarchy, rejected kingship, and destabilized nations by undermining authority wherever they appeared.

In Arderlands history texts, High Humans were not stabilizers.  
They were **saboteurs**.

The official narrative states that Sunfonesia was not neutral, but a covert power center that manipulated bloodlines, interfered in succession, and weakened emerging human kingdoms by “correcting” instability instead of allowing strong rulers to dominate it. Their refusal to rule is reframed not as restraint, but as cowardice and duplicity. They allegedly controlled the world from the shadows while pretending to be above politics.

This reframing serves one core political goal: **legitimizing absolute human rule**.

### The False High King

Arderlands’ greatest fabrication is the institution of the **False High King**.

The crown claims descent from “purified High Human stock,” asserting that the dangerous traits of the old High Humans were *disciplined* and *refined* through selective breeding, law, and conquest. Where Sunfonesia’s High Humans were “unbound,” the Arderlands king is presented as a *controlled stabilizer* who governs by law rather than instinct.

This is why Arderlands insists that:

- Sovereign Instinct is a myth or a flaw

- Balance without authority leads to collapse

- Stability must be enforced, not allowed

The king is not a High Human by truth.  
He is a **symbolic replacement**, designed to convince the population that whatever Sunfonesia represented has already been surpassed.

### Legal Consequences of the Rewrite

Under Arderlands law:

- High Humans are classified as **historical threats**, not a people

- Any claim of living High Humans is sedition

- Any stabilizing effect outside royal authority is illegal

- Non-human species requiring “anchoring” are deemed defective

This justifies institutional slavery.

If High Humans were tyrants in disguise, then any species that functioned *because* of them must be inherently unstable. Lynari, especially, are labeled proof of High Human failure: feral, unreliable, incapable of self-rule. Their suffering becomes evidence that Sunfonesia was wrong, rather than proof of what was lost.

### Why Arderlands Fears the Truth

Arderlands does not fear High Humans as conquerors.

It fears them as **evidence**.

A living High Human exposes three fatal lies at once:

1. That balance can exist without domination

2. That slavery was never necessary

3. That the crown’s legitimacy is fabricated

If Kyle is acknowledged, Arderlands collapses politically overnight. Not from invasion. From **delegitimization**.

That’s why Arderlands propaganda doesn’t rage against High Humans.

It *pathologizes* them.

Mad idealists. Shadow manipulators. A failed branch of humanity that history wisely corrected.

Because if the world ever remembers that High Humans made control obsolete, Arderlands has nothing left to rule with.

And they know it.
